# Potato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This project is focused on detecting **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, and **Healthy** potato leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch and trained on a custom-preprocessed dataset. It also includes a **Node.js frontend** and a **Dockerized backend** for end-to-end usability.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

-  Classifies potato leaf images into **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, or **Healthy**
- Custom image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- CNN built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Frontend for image upload and prediction display (Node.js)
- Backend served via API (Flask/Django) integrated with Docker
- Accuracy metrics and visual results
- Clean and modular codebase
